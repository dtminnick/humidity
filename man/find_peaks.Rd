\title{Find Peaks}
\usage{
find_peaks(source, m = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{source}{Vector, list or data frame input.}

\item{m}{Number of adjacent points on each side of a value to include in
evaluation.  Defaults to a value of 3.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing indices of the peak values from the
original source data.
}
\description{
\code{find_peaks} detects local peaks in values in a vector or data frame
using a threshold for comparing each value to adjacent values.  It returns a
numeric vector containing the indices of those peak values.
}
\details{
A peak value is defined as a maximum value with a set of values
with a set number of points either side of the value being smaller than it.
The \code{find_peaks} function becomes more stringent in identifying a peak
as the number of adjacent points evaluated increases.

\examples{

source <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

peaks <- find_peaks(source, 4)
