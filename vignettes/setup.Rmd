## Hardware

The followed hardware components enabled collection of humidity data:

1. Raspberry Pi Zero W with 512 MB RAM, 1 GHz CPU, single core, 802.11 wireless 
LAN, 2.5a power supply, case and 40-pin GPIO header,

2. Waveshare BME280 environmental sensor with I2C/SPI interface and six-pin jumper
wires, and

3. 128 GB micro SD card.

## Raspberry Pi Setup

Headless setup of the Raspberry Pi involves the following steps.  A headless setup 
is the Raspberry Pi minus a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.  Running a headless setup 
enables direct control the Raspberry Pi wirelessly from another computer, in this
case, my Windows laptop.

[This article](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-headless-setup-how-to,6028.html) provides detailed setup instructions.  

1. Insert the micro SD card in computer.

2. Install and run the Raspberry Pi Imager (available for download from raspberrypi.com).

3. Launch the imager application and install the Raspberry Pi OS on the micro SD card.

4. Write an empty text file named "ssh" with no file extension to the root of 
the directory of the card. When the Raspberry Pi OS sees the ssh file on its first 
boot-up, it will automatically enable SSH (Secure Socket Shell), which will allow 
you to remotely access the Pi command line from your computer.

5. Configure a network connection for your Raspberry Pi using Wi-Fi Ethernet. Create 
a text file called wpa_supplicant.conf and place it in the root directory of the 
micro SD card with the following text included in the file.

country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
scan_ssid=1
ssid="your_wifi_ssid"
psk="your_wifi_password"
}

6. Establish an SSH connection to the Raspberry Pi using an SSH client.  In my case,
I used Putty, an SSH client for Windows using "raspberrypi" as the address and "pi"
as a username with a corresponding password.  This enables you to connect to the Raspberry 
Pi at the command prompt.

7. If you want to access the Raspberry Pi via a GUI, you need to enable VNC on the 
Raspberry Pi.

## GPIO Header

To connect the BME280 sensor to the Raspberry Pi, you need to mount the Raspberry Pi
on the GPIO 40-pin header and solder the header in place.  When soldering the header 
to the Pi start with one of the corner pins. To make a good connection, heat 
the header pin and to let it melt the solder.  Donâ€™t melt the solder directly with 
the iron and expect it to stick.  [This article](https://dronebotworkshop.com/soldering-raspberry-pi-zero-gpio/) provides detail
on how to go about soldering the GPIO to the Pi.

## BME280 Sensor Connection

The Waveshare BME280 sensor supports both SPI and I2C interfaces and you'll need to decide what 
interface you will use.  [This article](https://medium.com/@rjrajbir24/difference-between-i2c-and-spi-i2c-vs-spi-c6a68d7242c4)
provides a good summary of each interface and comparison.

[This webpage](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/BME280_Environmental_Sensor) provides 
details instructions on how to connect the BME280 sensor to the Pi's GPIO board, according
to the interface you choose to use.

Using the I2C interface, I wired the sensor as follows:

Connection | GPIO Pin | GPIO Description | BME280 Pin | BME280 Description 
-----------|----------|------------------|------------|-------------------
Power Input | 1 | 3.3v power | 1 | VCC
I2C data line | 3 | GPIO (SDA) | 3 | SDA
I2C clock line | 5 | GPIO (SCL) | 4 | SCL
Ground | 14 | GND | 2 | GND

After connecting the sensor, I enabled the I2C interface on the Pi, rebooted the Pi
and confirmed that the I2C module was enabled.  I then checked to make sure that the
sensor was connected to the Pi at correct address (0x77 by default).
