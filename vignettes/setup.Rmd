## Hardware

The followed hardware components enabled collection of humidity data:

1. Raspberry Pi Zero W with 512 MB RAM, 1 GHz CPU, single core, 802.11 wireless 
LAN, 2.5a power supply, case and 40-pin GPIO header,

2. Waveshare BME280 environmental sensor with I2C/SPI interface and six-pin jumper
wires, and

3. 128 GB micro SD card.

## Raspberry Pi Setup

Headless setup of the Raspberry Pi involved the following steps:

1. Insert the micro SD card in computer.

2. Install and run the Raspberry Pi Imager (available for download from raspberrypi.com).

3. Launch the imager application and install the Raspberry Pi OS on the micro SD card.

4. Write an empty text file named "ssh" with no file extension to the root of 
the directory of the card. When the Raspberry Pi OS sees the ssh file on its first 
boot-up, it will automatically enable SSH (Secure Socket Shell), which will allow 
you to remotely access the Pi command line from your computer.

5. Configure a network connection for your Raspberry Pi using Wi-Fi Ethernet. Create 
a text file called wpa_supplicant.conf and place it in the root directory of the 
micro SD card with the following text included in the file.

country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
scan_ssid=1
ssid="your_wifi_ssid"
psk="your_wifi_password"
}

6. Establish an SSH connection to the Raspberry Pi using an SSH client.  In my case,
I used Putty, an SSH client for Windows using "raspberrypi" as the address and "pi"
as a username with a corresponding password.  This enables you to connect to the Raspberry 
Pi at the command prompt.

7. If you want to access the Raspberry Pi via a GUI, you need to enable VNC on the 
Raspberry Pi.
